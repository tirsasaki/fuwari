Managing disk partitions is an essential skill for anyone working with Linux systems. Whether you're setting up a new hard drive, resizing existing partitions, or troubleshooting storage issues, tools like `fdisk` and `GParted` are invaluable. This guide will walk you through formatting and partitioning disks using these two powerful tools.

## Why Partitioning Matters
Partitioning a disk organizes storage into separate sections, making it easier to manage and optimize performance. It also helps when you need to install multiple operating systems or separate data from the system files.

## Using `fdisk` for Disk Management

`fdisk` is a command-line utility for creating and managing disk partitions. Follow these steps to use `fdisk`:

1. **Identify Your Disk**  
   Use the command `lsblk` or `fdisk -l` to list all available disks and partitions. Identify the target disk (e.g., `/dev/sda`).

2. **Launch fdisk**  
   Run the following command, replacing `/dev/sda` with your target disk:  
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sda
   ```

3. **Create a New Partition**  
   - Press `n` to create a new partition.  
   - Choose the partition type (primary or extended).  
   - Set the partition size.  

4. **Write Changes to Disk**  
   After making changes, press `w` to write them to the disk.

5. **Format the Partition**  
   Format the new partition using a file system like ext4:  
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
   ```

## Using GParted for a GUI-Based Approach

For those who prefer graphical interfaces, GParted simplifies disk management:

1. **Install GParted**  
   Use the following command to install GParted on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install gparted
   ```

2. **Launch GParted**  
   Open GParted with administrative privileges:  
   ```bash
   sudo gparted
   ```

3. **Select Your Disk**  
   From the dropdown menu in the top-right corner, select the disk you want to manage.

4. **Create or Resize Partitions**  
   - Right-click on unallocated space and choose "New" to create a partition.  
   - Adjust the size, file system, and label as needed.

5. **Apply Changes**  
   Click the green checkmark to apply the changes.
