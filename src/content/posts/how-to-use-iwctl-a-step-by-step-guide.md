**Iwctl** is a lightweight and efficient CLI tool for managing WiFi on Linux. This article provides a step-by-step guide on installing, using, and configuring iwctl through its configuration files to optimize your WiFi connections.

## **What is iwctl?**

`Iwctl` is a CLI for **iwd (iNet Wireless Daemon)**, a modern wireless daemon for Linux. Compared to `wpa_supplicant`, iwd is lighter, faster, and more user-friendly.

## Steps to Use IWCTL

**1. Open Terminal and Start IWCTL**

```
iwctl
```  

**2. List Wireless Devices**
```
device list 
```
This displays detected Wi-Fi devices.

3. Scan Available Wi-Fi Networks  
```
station device_name get-networks 
```
Replace `<device_name>` with your device name.

**4. Connect to a Wi-Fi Network**  
```
station device_name connect SSID 
```
Enter the password when prompted.

**5. Verify Connection**
```
station device_name show 
```
### Troubleshooting Tips

  * Ensure the kernel module for your Wi-Fi device is loaded.
  * Check the iwd service status using `systemctl status iwd` if IWCTL isn’t running.

### FAQ

  1. **What to do if IWCTL doesn’t detect the Wi-Fi device?**  
    Verify if your device is recognized using `lsusb` or `lspci`, and ensure drivers are installed.

  2. **How can I save a Wi-Fi connection for automatic reconnection?**  
    IWCTL automatically saves the network after a successful connection.

  3. **Does IWCTL support WPA3 security?**  
    Yes, IWCTL supports WPA3 security if your hardware is compatible.

IWCTL is a simple yet powerful tool for managing Wi-Fi networks on Linux. By using this tool, you can save time and resources without needing additional software.
