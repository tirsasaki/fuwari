Opera is a sleek, feature-rich browser with built-in ad blocking, a free VPN, and customizable tools, making it an attractive choice for Linux users. However, since Opera is not included in the official Arch Linux repositories, you'll need to install it from the Arch User Repository (AUR). This guide will show you how to do that using the `yay` AUR helper.

## Steps to Install Opera on Arch Linux Using Yay

### 1. **Install Yay (if not already installed)**  
If you haven't installed `yay`, follow these steps to set it up:  

```bash
sudo pacman -S git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

### 2. **Search for Opera in AUR**  
Once `yay` is installed, search for available Opera packages:  

```bash
yay -Ss opera
```

You should see the following options:
- `opera` (Stable version)
- `opera-beta` (Beta version)
- `opera-developer` (Developer version)

### 3. **Install Opera**  
To install the stable version of Opera, run:  

```bash
yay -S opera
```

If you'd prefer the beta or developer versions, use:
```bash
yay -S opera-beta
# or
yay -S opera-developer
```

### 4. **Launch Opera**  
Once the installation is complete, start Opera using:  

```bash
opera
```
